	The “three 10’s” stands for the unusual coincidence of the earthquake happening on October 10, 2025, at exactly 10:00 in the morning. Many people found it strange and chilling because all the numbers lined up to ten — the 10th day, the 10th month, and the 10th hour. This made the event more memorable and frightening for those who experienced it. The “10-10-10” became a way to describe how shocking and unforgettable that day was for the people of Mindanao.
