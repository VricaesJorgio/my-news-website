	  Earthquakes happen when parts of the Earth’s crust suddenly move because of the pressure that builds up deep underground. These movements cause shaking that we can feel on the surface. The Philippines often experiences earthquakes because it lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where many active faults and volcanoes are found.	
	</p>

	  The strength of an earthquake depends on how big the movement is and how close people are to the epicenter. That’s why some quakes feel stronger in certain places. For example, during earthquake, people near Davao and General Santos City felt intense shaking, while those farther away felt milder tremors.
	</p>

	 To stay safe during an earthquake, remember to “Duck, Cover, and Hold”. Duck under something sturdy like a table, cover your head, and hold on until the shaking stops. Avoid running outside while the ground is shaking because falling debris can be dangerous. After the quake, check your surroundings and stay alert for aftershocks.

	  Earthquakes can be scary, but being prepared helps us stay calm and safe. Knowing what to do before, during, and after a quake can make a big difference when the ground suddenly starts to move.
