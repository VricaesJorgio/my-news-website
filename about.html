	  <h2>About Us</h2>
	  
	  <p>
	  We created this website as part of a school project focused on reporting and documenting real-life events that have made a big impact on people’s lives. The earthquake that hit Mindanao on October 10, 2025, is one of the most unforgettable disasters in recent years since 2023. It caused fear, panic, and damage in many parts of the region, especially in Davao.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Through this website, we aim to inform and educate others about what really happened during that tragic morning. We gathered information from different sources, news reports, and personal stories to give readers a clearer picture of how people experienced the quake and how they managed to recover afterward.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Our goal is not just to tell what happened, but also to raise awareness about earthquake safety and preparedness. By understanding the experiences of others, we can learn how to stay calm, alert, and ready when faced with similar emergencies.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  This page represents the hard work, teamwork, and dedication of students who want to make a difference through sharing knowledge. We hope this website encourages everyone to be informed, prepared, and compassionate toward those who experience natural disasters.
